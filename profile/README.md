# 🎓 Welcome to f-ras-42Course

This organization hosts a collection of projects developed during the 42 program, showcasing various aspects of software development and computer science.

## 📚 About the 42Course

The 42 course is an intensive programming curriculum designed to foster self-learning, peer-to-peer education, and real-world project experience. Participants engage in a series of progressively challenging projects that cover a wide range of topics, from fundamental programming to advanced system engineering.

## 🌟 Repository Highlights

Here are some of the key repositories in this organization:

- **[-INDEX-](https://github.com/f-ras-42Course/-INDEX-)**: 📌 Start here to get a comprehensive overview of all the projects in the curriculum, presented in the recommended order.

- **[webserv](https://github.com/f-ras-42Course/webserv)**: 🌐 A project focused on building a simple HTTP web server from scratch in C++. It handles client requests, parses configurations, manages sockets, and supports features like CGI execution and concurrent connections, mimicking the behavior of servers like Nginx or Apache.

- **[Minishell](https://github.com/f-ras-42Course/minishell)**: 🖥️ A minimalistic UNIX shell implementation in C that supports command execution, pipes, redirections, environment variables, and signal handling. This project replicates key features of Bash, reinforcing understanding of system calls and process management.

- **[cub3D](https://github.com/f-ras-42Course/cub3d)**: 🎮 A project that involves creating a 3D game using the Raycasting technique, inspired by the classic game Wolfenstein 3D. It serves as an introduction to graphical programming and game development.

- **[push_swap](https://github.com/f-ras-42Course/push_swap)**: 🔢 An algorithmic project that requires sorting a stack of numbers using only two stacks (a and b) and a limited set of operations. The goal is to implement an efficient sorting algorithm with the least number of moves, testing problem-solving and optimization skills in C.
